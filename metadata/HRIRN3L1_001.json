  "Abstract" : "HRIRN3L1 is the High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR) Nimbus-3 Level 1 Meteorological Radiance Data (NMRT) product and contains infrared radiances converted to equivalent black-body temperature or \"brightness\" temperature values. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from magnetic tapes, also referred to as Nimbus Meteorological Radiation Tapes (NMRT). The data are archived in their original IBM 36-bit word proprietary format, also referred to as a binary TAP file.\n\nThe HRIR instrument was designed to perform two major functions: first to map the Earth's cloud cover at night to complement the television coverage during the daytime portion of the orbit, and second to measure the temperature of cloud tops and terrain features.  The HRIR flown on Nimbus-3 was modified to allow nighttime and daytime cloud cover mapping  by use of dual band-pass filter which transmits 0.7 to 1.3 micron, and 3.4 to 4.2 micron radiation.  The HRIR instrument was launched on the Nimbus-3 satellite and was operational from April 14, 1966 through July 22, 1969. Nighttime operation was made in the 3.4 to 4.2 micron near infrared region.  Daytime operation was based on the predominance of reflected solar energy in the 0.7 to 1.3 micron region.  Change-over from nighttime to daytime operation was accomplished automatically (or by ground station command), by actuating a relay in the early stages of the radiometer electronics.  The system gain was reduced in the daytime mode to compensate for the higher energy levels.\n\nThis product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00222 (old ID 69-037A-02C).",
